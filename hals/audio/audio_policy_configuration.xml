    <!-- Modules section:
        There is one section per audio HW module present on the platform.
        Each module section will contains two mandatory tags for audio HAL “halVersion” and “name”.
        The module names are the same as in current .conf file:
                “primary”, “A2DP”, “remote_submix”, “USB”
        Each module will contain the following sections:
        “devicePorts”: a list of device descriptors for all input and output devices accessible via this
        module.
        This contains both permanently attached devices and removable devices.
        “mixPorts”: listing all output and input streams exposed by the audio HAL
        “routes”: list of possible connections between input and output devices or between stream and
        devices.
            "route": is defined by an attribute:
                -"type": <mux|mix> means all sources are mutual exclusive (mux) or can be mixed (mix)
                -"sink": the sink involved in this route
                -"sources": all the sources than can be connected to the sink via vis route
        “attachedDevices”: permanently attached devices.
        The attachedDevices section is a list of devices names. The names correspond to device names
        defined in <devicePorts> section.
        “defaultOutputDevice”: device to be used by default when no policy rule applies
